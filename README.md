# Discord Video Manipulator

I bet you've already seen some cursed discord videos with negative length or those which are hilariously long.

This tool allows to skip the process of going through hex editors and searching correct bytes. Why not let a computer do it?

Installation:


``FOR WINDOWS``


1. Download this repository, either through this website or by using:
```
git clone https://github.com/DrSTAHP/Discord_Video_Manipulator.git <your optional desired directory here>
```

2. Enter the downloaded repository.

3. Launch:
```
vidmanip.exe
```


``FOR LINUX``


1. Download this repository, either through this website or by using:
```
git clone https://github.com/DrSTAHP/Discord_Video_Manipulator_Linux.git <your optional desired directory here>
```
2. Enter the downloaded repository:
```
cd Discord_Video_Manipulator_Linux
```
3. Now you need to compile the source code, run:
```
make
```
4. It should be done by now, run the program:
```
./vidmanip
```

You can use parameters as well for both platforms, you can find a list of them in `flags.txt`.

Have fun!
