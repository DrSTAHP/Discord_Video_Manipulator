# Discord_Video_Manipulator

I bet you've already seen some cursed discord videos with negative length or those which are hilariously long.
This tool allows to skip the process of going through hex editors and searching correct bytes. Why not let a computer do it?

Goals:

`-Support for WEBM: ❌ `
`-Video crashing: ❌ `
`-More user-friendly environment: ❌ `
